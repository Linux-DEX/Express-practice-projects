# GraphQL

GraphQL is an open-source query language for Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and a server-side runtime for executing those queries. It provides a more efficient, flexible, and developer-friendly alternative to traditional REST APIs, particularly in scenarios with complex data requirements or rapidly evolving client-side needs

- **Client-driven Data Fetching**: Clients specify exactly what data they need in a single request, avoiding over-fetching (receiving unnecessary data) and under-fetching (requiring multiple requests for related data). This is achieved through a query language that allows for precise selection of fields and nested objects. 

```graphQL
query {
  hero {
    name
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, which often utilizes multiple endpoints for different resources, a GraphQL API typically exposes a single endpoint to which all queries and mutations are sent. 
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: A GraphQL API defines a strongly typed schema that describes all available data and operations (queries, mutations, and subscriptions). This schema acts as a contract between the client and server, enabling validation and providing clear documentation. 
- **Queries and Mutations**: 
	• Queries: are used to retrieve data from the server. 
	• Mutations: are used to modify data on the server (create, update, or delete). 

- **Real-time Data with Subscriptions**: GraphQL supports subscriptions, allowing clients to receive real-time updates when specific data changes on the server. 
- **Platform Agnostic**: GraphQL is a specification and can be implemented in various programming languages and integrated with diverse data sources. 

**Benefits of using GraphQL APIs:**

- **Reduced Over-fetching and Under-fetching**: Clients get precisely the data they need, optimizing network usage and performance. 
- **Improved Developer Experience**: The clear schema and flexible querying capabilities streamline development and make API interactions more intuitive. 
- **Faster Iteration**: Frontend and backend teams can work more independently, as changes to data requirements can often be handled on the client-side without requiring backend modifications. 
- **Efficient Data Aggregation**: Clients can fetch related data from multiple sources in a single request, simplifying complex data retrieval scenarios.
